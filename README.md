# Query's Quest
Query's Quest is an adventure game based off of an early 90's computer game called Chip's Challenge. Chip's Challenge was one of the first video games I ever played, so it has a special place in my heart. It started as a simple console version, and now I have developed a GUI for it using Qt. It has been fun to add on new features as my skills have progressed.

The game is played on a 2D game board with several rooms containing different obstacles. Query must collect enough queries (?) in order to unlock the final gate. Along the way, Query may encounter locked doors, slippery ice, or deadly fire and water. Query may also find special boots to protect him from the elements, as well as keys to unlock doors. 

Eventually, I would like to add more levels, just like the game that inspired it. 

## Usage
Use the arrow keys to navigate through the game board. 
Collect colored keys to unlock the corresponding doors.
Collect element boots for ability to traverse the corresponding elements (ice, water, fire).
Collect all the queries (?) to unlock the final door.

## Deployment
For now, to deploy and play this version of Queries Quest you have clone this repository and compile the game code on your own machine. I would recommend using Qt Creator for that part.

Alternatively, you can checkout the console version on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@sgilbo/Querys-Quest).

Coming soon - I am working on building the Qt version for web assembly to get it hosted online.
